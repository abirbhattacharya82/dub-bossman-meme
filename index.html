            <h3>Dub Bossman Meme</h3>
            <p>Dub Bossman is a slang term used to describe a win in football, dub being a deviation of "W," meaning win. It is mostly used in the context of calling the person who collected the win "bossman," a slang term meaning winner or champion. In 2020, the term became a pseudo nickname for UK YouTube channel host Robbie Lyle, who has been the subject of numerous memes referring to him as the "Dub Bossman" on Twitter. Memes of Lyle typically feature an image formatted like a Snapchat image, with a black-barred caption across the center of the frame. In the image, Lyle is commenting on a "dub" or win.</p>
